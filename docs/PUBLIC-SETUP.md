# Install, operate, and migrate your own Libregram

## Local installation

Use Linux with Node.js 24+, pnpm 12.10.1, FFmpeg/FFprobe, Git, and Bash. The lockfile fixes dependency versions. Install pnpm using `npm install -g pnpm@12.10.1`; install FFmpeg on Debian using `sudo apt-get install ffmpeg`. Node must be on PATH, or installed privately at `.runtime/node/bin/node`.

Clone the repository or extract a release, enter its folder, and run `./libregram setup`. This generates private environment files, installs dependencies, applies the Prisma schema to an empty database, and builds. The initial username is `admin`; its random password is stored in `.env.local`. Read it locally without sharing that file. Run `./libregram start`, then open `http://localhost:3000/admin/login`. Use the square-plus for uploads and the settings cogwheel for account/header settings. Fresh setup explicitly uses password login; Cloudflare is optional and disabled until configured and chosen.

The release contains no gallery media or populated database. `.env.example` is a configuration reference with placeholders, not usable login credentials. `.env` holds Prisma's database URL; `.env.local` holds Next.js settings. Keep their `DATABASE_URL` values aligned. `file:./dev.db` resolves to `prisma/dev.db`. Changing `NEXT_PUBLIC_BIRTH_DATE` requires a rebuild.

Manual equivalent:

```bash
node scripts/setup.mjs
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm db:push
pnpm build
pnpm start
```

Setup is intended for initialization; it does not reset existing accounts, media, or environment files. Review schema changes before applying them to existing data. Never accept a destructive Prisma reset without a verified backup.

## Start, stop, restart, and reboot

`./libregram start` runs in the foreground; keep that terminal open. In another terminal in the same folder, use `./libregram status`, `./libregram stop`, or `./libregram restart`. A restart starts the existing production build; rebuild after source changes. Ctrl+C also stops a foreground launcher. The default port is 3000 on all interfaces, so other Wi-Fi devices can use the server's LAN address. The launcher refuses to use a busy port.

Use systemd on Debian for boot startup. Run setup and the production build as a **non-root** account that owns the checkout. Install Node 24 system-wide or privately in `.runtime/node/bin/node`; the root deployment script needs to locate it. Use a checkout path without spaces, quotes, backslashes, or percent signs. In that folder:

```bash
sudo bash deploy/setup-debian-root.sh "$USER"
sudo systemctl status "libregram@$USER" --no-pager
systemctl is-enabled "libregram@$USER"
```

The installer infers its actual checkout path, installs prerequisites, renders the service, stops a foreground launcher, and enables the boot service. It does not grant the application user sudo access. The template installer supports one checkout per machine. Replace `youruser` below with that account:

```bash
sudo systemctl stop libregram@youruser
sudo systemctl start libregram@youruser
sudo systemctl restart libregram@youruser
sudo journalctl -u libregram@youruser -n 100 --no-pager
sudo systemctl disable --now libregram@youruser
sudo systemctl enable --now libregram@youruser
```

After `sudo reboot`, enabled services start automatically. Do not also start a foreground copy on the same port. Inspect systemd status/logs if the site is unavailable.

## Back up and migrate

Stop the application before copying the SQLite database. Store `prisma/dev.db`, the complete `public/uploads/` directory, `.env.local`, `.env`, `.runtime/admin-auth.json`, `.runtime/visitor-exclusions.json`, and `.runtime/shared-links/` (when present) in a separate **private** backup. Shared URLs depend on those shared-link files. See the copy commands in [Operations](OPERATIONS.md#backups-and-migration). SQLite contains posts, account hashes, hearts, site settings, and visitor records. Generated media is also under uploads. Favorites belong to each viewer's browser and are not a server backup.

On the destination machine, install prerequisites, clone the desired release tag, and install dependencies with `./libregram install`. Restore private files to the same relative paths and keep restrictive environment-file permissions (`chmod 600 .env .env.local`). As the owning user, run `pnpm db:push` after reviewing its proposed schema changes, then `./libregram build`. Start locally or install the boot service. Check the gallery, login, and media before switching traffic. Do not run setup to generate a second account when restoring an existing database.

## Update the application

Stop the application, make a private backup, and record the old Git revision first. Prefer a published release tag:

```bash
git fetch origin --tags
git checkout v1.5.0  # Substitute the release you intend to install.
./libregram install
# Review schema changes, then apply only if appropriate:
pnpm db:push
```

v1.4.0 introduced optional visitor latitude/longitude, duration, last-update time, and a location-source field with a default for older rows. Back up SQLite first, then apply `pnpm db:push` before building when upgrading from an earlier schema. Existing posts, visitor history, credentials, and login mode stay intact. Upgrades from v1.1.0 or earlier also need the optional soundtrack fields introduced in v1.2.0. Never use `--accept-data-loss` or reset the existing database.

v1.5.0 names the project Libregram, adds region filtering, and uses the configured gallery title for browser tabs. There are no new columns; the schema's default gallery title becomes Libregram for new installations. See [rename and upgrade compatibility](RENAMING.md) before changing an older deployment's service names. Keep an existing checkout in place: new GitHub URLs and new launch commands do not require moving private data.

For a foreground installation: `./libregram stop`, `./libregram build`, `./libregram start`.

For systemd, run `sudo bash deploy/rebuild-archive-root.sh youruser`. This stops the service, preserves the previous production build, builds as the owning user, restarts, and checks readiness. Failed builds restore the previous build. This is a build rollback, not a database/source rollback; keep a database backup and record the previous Git revision before updating. Dependency installation and schema changes must already be complete.

`./libregram update` updates dependency versions and the lockfile; it is a developer operation, not the normal release-upgrade command. Public releases are source-only and contain no automatic destructive migrations.

## HTTPS, Google Cast, and AirPlay

For public hosting, install Cloudflare's official cloudflared binary for your architecture at `/usr/local/bin/cloudflared`, verifying its published release digest. Follow the [official downloads](https://developers.cloudflare.com/tunnel/downloads/) and [Cloudflare instructions](CLOUDFLARE.md). The installer also supports the specifically pinned original amd64 binary staged at `.runtime/cloudflared/cloudflared`; a different staged version requires updating its pinned digest deliberately.

With the application boot service installed:

```bash
sudo bash deploy/setup-cloudflare-root.sh youruser
```

This installs the tunnel boot service, requests a temporary HTTPS URL, and enables secure cookies and loopback proxy trust. Use HTTPS for admin login afterwards. The service's process survives reboots, but a Quick Tunnel's hostname changes after restart. To use a domain, enroll a named tunnel in Cloudflare and run `sudo bash deploy/use-named-cloudflare-tunnel.sh`, pasting its token at the hidden prompt. The token is stored outside the checkout. See [Cloudflare](CLOUDFLARE.md) for dashboard routes and service operations.

Cast the selected media from the HTTPS gallery. The receiver needs access to that media without an admin cookie. Do not put Cloudflare Access in front of media endpoints unless you have designed compatible receiver authentication. The gallery, `/s/*` share pages, public media, and cast-slide endpoints remain public; admin routes require a signed session. Make sure the media you host is intended to be public. Keep a stable public hostname for shared links, and preserve Range/CORS headers for video seeking and receiver playback.

Optional Cloudflare identity login is separate from HTTPS hosting: see [Administration](ADMIN.md#optional-cloudflare-sign-in). Leaving the default password mode selected requires no identity-provider configuration.
